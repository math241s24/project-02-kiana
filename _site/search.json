    "text": "Goals\nMy high level goal is to create an animated spatio-temporal visualization of wildfires in California comparing land management agencies. This will be a map of wildfires in California (with land management agency boundaries mapped), animated to reflect wildfires over time.\n\nCalifornia is known to have intense wildfire seasons, that can have devastating impacts both to communities immediately impacted by the burn through destruction of property and lives lost, as well as far reaching consequences as smoke impacts other communities as well. There are a variety of public land managers in California such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), California State Parks, United States Department of the Interior, the US Forest Service (USFS), California State Lands Commission, and the National Park Service (NPS). In order to develop effective management strategies and effectively allocate resources, it is necessary to identify relevant stakeholders. My project hopes to address one aspect of this by considering which agencies are most directly impacted by wildfires. Additionally, these different land management agencies employ different wildfire mitigation strategies as they serve different functions; In order to assess the efficiency of varying wildfire mitigation strategies it is useful to consider the prevalence of wildfires across these agencies. It is ultimately important to recognize the complexity of the issue of wildfires and acknowledge the limitations of a mapping project like this in articulating the relationship between land management strategy and the reality of wildfires."

    "text": "Approach\n\nShifting from Land Management Agencies to Counties\nAfter some preliminary data exploration it became clear that comparing wildfires across land management agency would not yield useful results given that the vast majority of public lands are federally managed (91% of total acreage, followed by 4% state, 2% local government etc), and it followed that the vast majority of wildfires occurring on public lands happened on federal land (Federal Land: 510 fires, 74.3%. State Land: 120 fires, 17.4%). In a data set spanning 1984 - 2020, there were years in which no fires occurred on non-federal land. Analysis would not be meaningful or statistically significant as there is simply not enough data for wildfires on land managed by non-federal entities.\nRecognizing this, I shifted my project goal to be comparing wildfires across different CA Counties, for an analysis of changing wildfires over time.\n\n \n\nThe PAD_CA dataset is too large to push to github so I have included prerendered plots comparing land use and fire burden across land management agencies as photos. Code can be viewed in project repo.\n\n\nWildfires Across California from 1984 - 2020\nI began by mapping wildfire perimeters and indicating counties experiencing wildfires to get a better sense of this issue.\n\n \n\nI then created line graphs considering fire count, acres burnt, and fire size in order to compare this issue across time.\n\nFire Count\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcres Burnt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Fire Size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWildfires Across CA Counties from 1984 - 2020\nI then focused my analysis on county comparisons looking at the same variables, creating maps and line plots.\n\nFrequency: Total Fires\n::: {style=“display: flex; flex-direction: row;”}:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity: Total Acres Burnt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity: Fire Size"

    "text": "Conclusions\nBased on this data exploration and visualizations I concluded that the burden of wildfires is increasing across all of California. Some counties, like Lassen, Riverside, and San Diego, are particularly impacted, being in the top 5 counties experienced variables associated with wildfire burden. Comparing across time, it was clear that some years were particularly devestating fire seasons like 2018 and 2012. This makes sense historically as 2018 had large fires like the Carr Fire, Mendocino Complex Fire, and the Camp Fire while 2012 had the Rush Fire, and Ponderosa Fire. Limitations of my project includes a lack of data as some years had more data then others. Additionally my approach was limited as the burden of wildfires can also be measured in variables like destruction, lives lost, and the impact of smoke. Data regarding these variables was not included in my datasets but could be investigated in further analysis.\nFurther research using these datasets could include consideration of wildfire causes and analysis of how that has changed over time and how it compares across counties. This would give a more holistic understanding of this issue particularly as it applies to wildfire management strategies."
